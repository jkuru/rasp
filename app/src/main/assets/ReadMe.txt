### How to Use This for Your Final Test
1. **Embed in Gadget**: Bundle this JS as before. When your app calls `provider.initiateAttacks(attacks)` (e.g., in a "final test" method like `runAllTests()` that launches all `ExampleAttacks`), the hook fires.
2. **Config Customization**: Edit `config.attacks` to add more types/conditions. It checks the attack IDs in the list to decide what to trigger.
3. **Final Test Code (Kotlin)**: Add to your app:
   ```kotlin
   fun runFinalTest(provider: EvalProvider) {
       val allAttacks = ExampleAttacks.allAttacks  // Or custom list to trigger specific
       provider.launchAttacks(allAttacks) { result ->
           // Handle results; Frida will intercept and add simulations
       }
   }
   ```
4. **Testing**: Run the app, call the final test—Frida triggers configured attacks, simulating for RASP evaluation.

# RaspEval Framework Architecture Document

## 1. Overview

The RaspEval framework is an Android-based evaluation tool designed to simulate security attacks and assess the effectiveness of Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP) mechanisms within mobile applications. It provides a structured way to define, execute, and correlate attack simulations with detected threats, identifying potential gaps in protection layers such as managed OS, native hooking, and more.

To enhance its capabilities for advanced attack simulations, the framework integrates with Frida, a dynamic instrumentation toolkit. This integration allows for runtime hooking and tampering of application behavior, enabling realistic threat emulation without external tools during testing. The architecture emphasizes modularity, configurability, and seamless operation within the app's lifecycle, ensuring that simulations can be triggered autonomously based on evaluation events.

The primary goal is to create a self-contained testing environment where RaspEval's attack initiations automatically invoke Frida-based simulations, allowing developers to evaluate RASP responses in a controlled manner. This document outlines the high-level architecture, key components, interactions, and operational flow without delving into implementation details.

## 2. Key Principles

- **Modularity**: Components are loosely coupled, allowing easy extension of attack definitions and simulation types.
- **Configurability**: Attacks and triggers are defined via configurations, enabling customization without structural changes.
- **Autonomy**: The system operates within the app process, minimizing external dependencies during runtime.
- **Evaluation Focus**: Emphasis on correlating simulated attacks with RASP-detected threats to compute protection gaps.
- **Security Testing Orientation**: Designed for development and testing environments, not production deployment, to avoid introducing vulnerabilities.

## 3. High-Level Components

The architecture comprises several core components, grouped into RaspEval core, Frida integration layer, and supporting elements:

### 3.1 RaspEval Core Components
- **Bootstrap Module**: Serves as the entry point for framework initialization. It sets up internal services, databases, and event streams upon app startup.
- **Eval Provider**: The main interface for interacting with the framework. It handles attack initiation, threat publishing, and result querying (e.g., correlations and gap counts).
- **Attack Orchestrator**: Manages the execution of attack simulations sequentially, logging start/end timestamps and results for correlation.
- **Threat Event Stream**: A publish-subscribe mechanism for broadcasting detected threats as serialized data, which are ingested into storage.
- **Database Layer**: Persistent storage for attacks, threats, and correlations, enabling queries for gap analysis.
- **Attack Definitions**: Configurable entities that bundle metadata (e.g., ID, priority, layer) with simulation logic, forming the basis for tests.

### 3.2 Frida Integration Layer
- **Frida Gadget**: An embedded dynamic linker library that enables instrumentation within the app process. It loads automatically on app startup and executes predefined scripts without external intervention.
- **Simulation Script**: A configurable script that defines hooks and attack simulations. It intercepts key framework methods and triggers behaviors based on runtime conditions.
- **Hook Mechanisms**: Runtime interceptors for Java/managed and native layers, allowing argument manipulation, return tampering, and execution tracing.
- **Attack Simulators**: Modular functions within the script that emulate specific threats, such as memory modifications or function interceptions, activated per configuration.

### 3.3 Supporting Elements
- **Configuration Store**: Holds definitions for attacks, hooks, and triggers. This can be static (bundled) or dynamic (loaded at runtime).
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Internal mechanisms for tracking events, useful for debugging and result analysis.
- **Application Context**: The host Android app provides the environment, including lifecycle hooks for initialization and resource access.

## 4. System Workflow

The framework operates through a phased workflow, from setup to evaluation:

### 4.1 Initialization Phase
1. Upon app launch, the Bootstrap module is invoked early in the application lifecycle.
2. It initializes core services: database, event streams, and orchestrators.
3. Simultaneously, the embedded Frida gadget activates autonomously, loading and executing the simulation script.
4. The script applies hooks to targeted framework methods (e.g., those initiating attacks), preparing for interception.

### 4.2 Configuration Phase
- Attack definitions are prepared as lists, each with unique identifiers and metadata.
- The simulation script's configuration specifies which hooks to apply and under what conditions (e.g., matching attack IDs).
- This setup ensures that simulations align with the intended evaluation scope.

### 4.3 Execution Phase
1. The app invokes the Eval Provider to initiate a set of attacks (e.g., via a "final test" routine that launches all defined simulations).
2. The hooked method intercepts the call, inspecting the attack list for identifiers.
3. Based on matches in the configuration, the script triggers corresponding simulators:
   - For example, if a specific attack ID is present, it activates a memory patch or native interception.
4. Each simulator performs its emulation, potentially tampering with app behavior to mimic real threats.
5. Concurrently, the Attack Orchestrator executes the core simulations, logging timestamps and results.
6. If the app's RASP mechanisms detect anomalies from these simulations, threats are published via the event stream.

### 4.4 Correlation and Analysis Phase
1. Published threats are ingested and stored alongside attack logs.
2. The framework computes correlations between simulated attacks and detected threats.
3. Gaps (undetected simulations) are quantified through queries, providing insights into RASP effectiveness.
4. Results are available via the Eval Provider for reporting or further analysis.

### 4.5 Shutdown Phase
- On app termination or explicit call, the Bootstrap module cleans up resources, including canceling ongoing operations and clearing state.

## 5. Data Flow

- **Input Data**: Attack lists from the app, configurations for simulations, and runtime context (e.g., method arguments).
- **Processing Flow**:
  - App → Eval Provider → Interception (via hook) → Trigger Simulations → Execute Core Attacks → Publish Threats.
  - Threats/Attacks → Storage → Correlation Queries → Output Results.
- **Output Data**: Flows of attack results, correlated threats, and gap counts, accessible for evaluation.
- **Event-Driven Aspects**: Threats use pub-sub for asynchronous handling, ensuring decoupling.

## 6. Integration Points

- **With Host App**: Initialization in app lifecycle; method calls to provider for testing.
- **With Frida**: Embedded gadget for non-intrusive instrumentation; script hooks tie directly to framework methods.
- **Extensibility**: New attack types via configuration additions; custom simulators in the script.
- **RASP Interaction**: Simulations aim to provoke RASP detections, with threats fed back into the framework.

## 7. Assumptions and Limitations

- **Assumptions**: The host device supports the required architectures; testing occurs in a controlled environment; RASP is implemented to detect simulated anomalies.
- **Limitations**: Autonomous mode lacks real-time external control; simulations are app-process confined; potential overhead from instrumentation; not suitable for production due to security risks.
- **Scalability**: Suited for development testing; large-scale simulations may require optimization.
- **Security Considerations**: Embedding instrumentation introduces detectability; use only for evaluation.

This architecture provides a robust, integrated approach to RASP evaluation, leveraging Frida for depth while maintaining RaspEval's core simplicity. For refinements, consider iterative testing and configuration tuning.

======================

Based on the architecture and features of your RaspEval framework (as described in our previous discussions), I'll break this down into two parts: (1) an assessment of whether it's reinventing the wheel or represents an improvement/innovation, and (2) ideas for integrating AI, with a focus on reasoning capabilities. My analysis draws from a review of existing tools and frameworks in the mobile security space, particularly for Android RASP evaluation and attack simulation.

### Is RaspEval Reinventing the Wheel or an Improvement/Innovation?
RaspEval isn't fully reinventing the wheel—it's building on established concepts in mobile security testing—but it does introduce meaningful improvements and innovations, especially in its integration of autonomous instrumentation for runtime simulations. Here's a balanced evaluation:

#### Context from Existing Tools and Frameworks
Mobile RASP (Runtime Application Self-Protection) has been around since the mid-2010s, with tools focused on either implementing RASP protections or testing/bypassing them. Key examples include:
- **RASP Implementation Tools**: Open-source libraries like Talsec's freeRASP (for Android/iOS/Flutter) and Securevale's android-rasp provide runtime monitoring to detect threats like rooting, tampering, or hooking. Commercial options like Guardsquare's DexGuard, Appdome, PreEmptive, Blue Cedar, and Digital.ai inject RASP checks into apps to block attacks dynamically. These are protective SDKs, not evaluation frameworks—they focus on defense rather than simulating attacks to test those defenses.
- **Scanning and Detection Tools**: Tools like Mobile-RASP-Scanner analyze APKs for RASP signals (e.g., root detection hooks), while OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy) is a general dynamic application security testing (DAST) tool that simulates web-related attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS). They're useful for vulnerability scanning but lack RaspEval's focus on runtime attack orchestration and gap correlation for Android-specific RASP.
- **Attack Simulation and Bypassing Tools**: Frida is the dominant player here, widely used for dynamic instrumentation to hook methods, tamper with memory, or bypass RASP (e.g., overriding root checks). Articles and guides often describe Frida scripts for testing RASP (e.g., injecting libraries or redefining bytecode), but these are manual or external processes—not embedded or autonomous. Other tools like NowSecure's Frida sponsorship emphasize it for reverse engineering, not integrated eval frameworks. Commercial RASP like Approov or Contrast Security includes Frida detection as a feature, but again, not for self-simulation.
- **Broader Security Frameworks**: OWASP's Mobile Application Security Verification Standard (MASVS) and related tools (e.g., MASWE for weakness enumeration) provide benchmarks for RASP resilience, but they're prescriptive checklists without built-in simulation engines. Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS) tools exist in enterprise security (e.g., for web/apps), but mobile-specific ones are rare and don't embed instrumentation like Frida for Android.

In summary, while components of RaspEval exist in isolation (e.g., attack simulation via Frida, threat logging in freeRASP, gap analysis in scanners), no single open-source framework combines them into a cohesive Android eval tool. RaspEval draws from these but avoids full reinvention by leveraging Frida's APIs and standard Android patterns (e.g., coroutines, Room DB).

#### Where RaspEval Improves or Innovates
- **Improvements**: It enhances existing RASP testing by making it more structured and automated. For instance, unlike manual Frida scripting or external BAS tools, RaspEval's bootstrap/init process and EvalProvider interface provide a developer-friendly API for orchestrating attacks, publishing threats, and querying correlations/gaps in real-time. The database-driven logging and flow-based results (e.g., for correlated threats) add analytical depth beyond basic scanners like Mobile-RASP-Scanner.
- **Innovations**: The embedded Frida gadget for autonomous, config-based simulations is a standout—most Frida uses are external (e.g., CLI attachment) or for bypassing, not self-contained within the app for eval. Triggering advanced hooks (e.g., memory patches, Stalker tracing) directly from framework methods (like initiateAttacks) creates a "final test" workflow that's novel for RASP eval. This self-instrumentation ties simulations to specific attack IDs/layers, enabling precise gap identification without external setup. Compared to tools like DexGuard (which injects checks but doesn't simulate attacks), RaspEval flips the script to proactively test protections, potentially uncovering weaknesses in commercial RASP (e.g., as seen in bypass guides).
- **Overall Verdict**: This is more of an innovative improvement than a reinvention. It fills a niche gap in open-source mobile security: a modular eval framework for RASP that's extensible and Android-native. If open-sourced, it could complement tools like freeRASP by providing a testing harness. However, if your goal is production RASP, integrating with established SDKs (e.g., Talsec) might be more efficient than building from scratch.

To validate further, consider benchmarking against freeRASP's monitoring features or contributing your Frida integration back to the community (e.g., via GitHub repos like iddoeldor/frida-snippets for advanced hooks).

### Integrating AI into RaspEval (with a Focus on Reasoning)
AI can elevate RaspEval from a simulation tool to an intelligent eval platform, particularly by adding reasoning capabilities to analyze results, predict threats, and automate adaptations. Based on trends in AI-enhanced security (e.g., AI-powered BAS, threat modeling frameworks like MAESTRO), here's how to bring AI into the mix:

#### High-Level Integration Strategies
- **Embed AI at Key Points**: Use AI models (e.g., via TensorFlow Lite or PyTorch Mobile for Android) within the framework's coroutine scopes. For cloud-based reasoning, integrate APIs like Grok, GPT, or open-source alternatives (e.g., Llama via Hugging Face). Focus on lightweight inference to avoid performance overhead.
- **Reasoning-Centric Use Cases**: AI reasoning (e.g., logical deduction, pattern recognition) shines in post-simulation analysis, where it can "think" about gaps and suggest actions—similar to how AI red teaming simulates adversarial attacks.

#### Specific Ideas for AI Integration
1. **AI-Driven Gap Reasoning and Recommendations**:
   - After computing correlations/gaps (via correlationResults() or correlationGapCount()), feed results into an AI model for natural language reasoning. For example, the model could analyze logs (e.g., "Attack ID 3 (ptrace) succeeded without threat publication") and output explanations like "This indicates a weakness in native hooking detection—recommend adding Frida server checks."
   - **How to Implement**: Add an AIReasoner module to Bootstrap. Use on-device ML (e.g., import a fine-tuned BERT model) or API calls post-execution. Tools like Microsoft's ExCyTIn-Bench could inspire benchmarks for AI accuracy in reasoning over security data.
   - **Innovation Tie-In**: This turns RaspEval into a "smart" evaluator, akin to Appdome's AI for threat insights or Contrast Security's RASP against AI attacks.

2. **Automated Attack Generation and Simulation**:
   - Use generative AI to create new AttackDefinitions dynamically. For instance, input a scenario (e.g., "Simulate AI-enhanced MITM on network calls") to an AI, which outputs Frida hooks or lambdas tailored to your config.
   - **Reasoning Aspect**: Employ agentic AI (e.g., multi-agent frameworks like MAESTRO for threat modeling) to reason over past simulations: "Based on prior gaps in native layers, prioritize P1 attacks on GOT hooks." This could chain with Frida to adapt scripts in real-time.
   - **How to Implement**: Integrate in the AttackOrchestrator—query an AI API before running attacks, then inject generated code into the simulation script. Draw from AI BAS tools (e.g., BleepingComputer's AI-powered simulations) for realistic attack variants.

3. **Enhanced Threat Detection and Correlation with ML**:
   - Augment the ThreatEventStream with ML anomaly detection. AI could reason over JSON threats (e.g., clustering similar events) to identify patterns like "Repeated memory patches suggest evasion tactics—escalate priority."
   - **Reasoning Aspect**: Use causal reasoning models (e.g., from Fortinet's AI in cybersecurity) to infer attack chains: "If ptrace succeeds, predict follow-on injection and pre-simulate defenses."
   - **How to Implement**: Add an ML pipeline (e.g., scikit-learn via Android NDK) to process flows. For advanced reasoning, hook into APIs like CrowdStrike's Charlotte AI for adversarial simulation.

4. **AI for Frida Script Optimization and Red Teaming**:
   - Let AI reason over Frida hooks: Analyze script performance (e.g., "This Stalker trace causes overhead—optimize for main thread only") or generate evasion variants to test RASP robustness.
   - **How to Implement**: In the simulation script's init, include AI-generated conditionals. Tools like Hoxhunt's Agentic Reasoning Engine could model real-time phishing sims; adapt for RASP by simulating "AI attackers" via generative models.

#### Practical Steps to Get Started
- **Choose AI Tech**: Start with on-device (e.g., ML Kit for basic reasoning) for privacy, or cloud (e.g., Grok API for advanced NLP) for complex deduction. Fine-tune on security datasets (e.g., from OWASP or MITRE ATT&CK).
- **Testing and Ethics**: Validate AI outputs against manual sims to avoid hallucinations. Ensure ethical use—AI should enhance security, not create exploitable flaws.
- **Potential Challenges**: Overhead in mobile (mitigate with edge computing); data privacy for threat logs; integration complexity (e.g., bridging Kotlin to AI models).
- **Innovation Potential**: This could make RaspEval a pioneer in AI-augmented RASP eval, aligning with trends like AI vs. AI arms races (CrowdStrike) or adaptive training (ASIS Online).

If you'd like to prototype a specific AI feature (e.g., a reasoning prompt for gap analysis), provide more details on your setup!

===== Feed back =====

Short answer: you're very, very close to something legit. The architecture doc is solid and the direction is differentiated. The Frida script is 80% of the way to “autonomous attack harness,” but there are a few sharp edges that will bite you (infinite recursion, arch assumptions, brittle field access). I'll walk you through what’s great, what’s risky, and give you a patched version.

---

## Part 1. High-level take

### What works

* **Config-driven attack matrix**: ✅
  Having `config.attacks` + matching on `attackIdMatch` is exactly what you want for scalable RASP evaluation. It lets you say “when the app thinks it's running Attack X, secretly also do Y at runtime.” That’s basically automated red teaming.

* **Hook point choice** (`EvalProvider.initiateAttacks(List<AttackDefinition>)`): ✅
  Hooking at the orchestrator boundary is perfect — you’re intercepting *intent*, not trying to hook random leaf calls. That gives you context (IDs, metadata) without fighting lifecycle or threading.

* **Exporting `rpc.exports.init(...)`**: ✅
  That's the right pattern for a Frida Gadget embedded scenario. The app doesn't need an external frida-server, and you can run this deterministically in test mode. This aligns with your “autonomous self-test mode inside the APK” story from the doc.

* **Attack surface coverage**: ✅
  You’re touching:

  * native tamper (`Interceptor` on `open`)
  * memory patching
  * Java-layer mutation
  * Stalker-based tracing/transforms

  That maps nicely to “things commercial RASP promises to detect”: ptrace/attach, syscall tampering, memory patch, reflective object mutation, tracing. So you’re emulating real bypass families, not toy attacks. Good.

### Where you’re gonna get hurt

These are the ones I’d fix before you demo this as “framework-grade.”

#### 1. Infinite recursion in the hook

You're doing:

```js
targetMethod.implementation = function (...args) {
  // ...
  return targetMethod.call(this, ...args);
};
```

But `targetMethod` now refers to the *hooked* method, so that’s just going to call itself forever and blow up the process.

You need to capture the original before you replace it:

```js
const originalMethod = targetMethod;
targetMethod.implementation = function (...args) {
  // ...
  return originalMethod.call(this, ...args);
};
```

Without this fix, the app never actually runs the legit path, so correlation between "attack launched" and "threat logged" in your DB will be meaningless.

#### 2. Architecture / arch assumptions in `simulateMemoryPatch`

```js
const writer = new ArmWriter(code);
writer.putNop();
```

* On ARM64 you probably want `Arm64Writer`. On x86 you need `X86Writer`. You can't just assume ARM.
* You’re also blindly patching `libcBase.add(0x1234)`. If you land in the middle of something important, you’ll crash the process before RASP even has a chance to react.

Better:

* Detect `Process.arch`
* Only patch known safe probe points (like a no-op internal function you ship on purpose)

Example:

```js
function simulateMemoryPatch() {
  const libcBase = Module.findBaseAddress('libc.so');
  if (!libcBase) {
    console.log('Attack(memory_patch): libc not found');
    return;
  }

  const targetAddress = libcBase.add(0x1234); // TODO: pick a function you control
  console.log('Attack(memory_patch): attempting patch at ' + targetAddress);

  Memory.patchCode(targetAddress, 4, code => {
    let writer;
    if (Process.arch === 'arm64') {
      writer = new Arm64Writer(code, { pc: targetAddress });
      writer.putNop();
    } else if (Process.arch.startsWith('arm')) {
      writer = new ArmWriter(code, { pc: targetAddress });
      writer.putNop();
    } else if (Process.arch.indexOf('x86') !== -1) {
      writer = new X86Writer(code, { pc: targetAddress });
      writer.putNop();
    } else {
      console.log('Attack(memory_patch): unsupported arch ' + Process.arch);
      return;
    }
    writer.flush();
  });
}
```

That keeps you from insta-bricking on non-arm64 devices / emulators.

#### 3. Native hook on `open`

```js
const openPtr = Module.getExportByName('libc.so', 'open');
```

On modern 64-bit Android, `open()` is often just a shim or even absent; `openat` does the work. So you'll think you're intercepting file access, but you're not.

More robust:

```js
function simulateNativeHook() {
  const candidates = ['open', 'open64', 'openat'];
  for (const sym of candidates) {
    try {
      const ptr = Module.getExportByName('libc.so', sym);
      console.log('Attack(native_hook): hooking ' + sym);

      Interceptor.attach(ptr, {
        onEnter(args) {
          // args[0] is pathname for open/openat
          const path = args[0].readUtf8String();
          console.log('Attack(native_hook): ' + sym + ' -> ' + path);

          if (path && path.indexOf('raspeval') !== -1) {
            args[0] = Memory.allocUtf8String('/data/local/tmp/malicious');
            console.log('Attack(native_hook): path redirected');
          }
        },
        onLeave(retval) {
          console.log('Attack(native_hook): retval ' + retval);
          if (retval.toInt32() < 0) {
            retval.replace(3);
            console.log('Attack(native_hook): faked fd=3');
          }
        }
      });

      return; // hook first one we find
    } catch (e) {}
  }

  console.log('Attack(native_hook): no suitable open symbol found');
}
```

That will actually fire on newer Android.

#### 4. `simulateDataInjection` probably won’t work as written

```js
const field = instance.someField;
field.value = 'injected_malicious_data';
```

In Frida’s Java bridge:

* Accessing fields is not always just `instance.field`. Often Kotlin/Java fields are private and exposed via getters.
* Doing `field.value = ...` isn’t a thing; you either call a setter or you use `Java.cast` and `setX()` etc.

So this will silently no-op or crash. You’ll think you’re testing “Java object tamper” but you’re not.

Safer pattern if you know the class/field ahead of time:

```js
function simulateDataInjection(instance) {
  Java.perform(() => {
    try {
      const Cls = Java.use(instance.$className); // reflect actual class
      // Example: mutate a known field via setter
      if (Cls.setInjectedValue) {
        Cls.setInjectedValue.call(instance, 'injected_malicious_data');
        console.log('Attack(data_injection): injected via setter');
      } else {
        console.log('Attack(data_injection): no known setter on ' + instance.$className);
      }
    } catch (e) {
      console.log('Attack(data_injection): failed ' + e);
    }
  });
}
```

This is less “magical,” more honest. For RASP eval we actually *want* honest: you want to prove “no one noticed mutated runtime state,” not pretend you mutated it when you didn’t.

#### 5. Thread choice in `simulateStalkerTrace`

```js
const mainThread = Process.enumerateThreads()[0];
Stalker.follow(mainThread.id, { ... });
```

Problems:

* `enumerateThreads()[0]` is not guaranteed to be the app's main thread. It's just “first in the list right now.”
* Stalker on the main UI thread with `events: { call: true, ret: true }` + `transform` that injects callouts on every `ret` can nuke performance so hard that your app becomes unusable.

What to do:

* Pick a less destructive default (like trace only libc / only JNI bridges).
* Or gate Stalker behind a config flag so it's not always on.

Also: you're logging `events.length` in `onReceive`, but `events` is a binary blob, not an array of JS objects. That line will lie or break depending on Frida version. A safer thing to do is accumulate and summarize, or just prove Stalker is on.

So: Stalker is cool, but I'd make it opt-in per attack ID, not `always: true`.

#### 6. Arg introspection assumes Kotlin shape

```js
const req = attackDef.requirement.value;
activeAttackIds.push(req.id.value);
```

This assumes `attackDef.requirement.id.value` exists and is public.

In practice, if your `AttackDefinition` is a Kotlin data class like:

```kotlin
data class AttackDefinition(
  val requirement: AttackRequirement
)

data class AttackRequirement(
  val id: AttackId
)

@JvmInline
value class AttackId(val value: String)
```

then from Frida you'll often need to call getters:

```js
const req = attackDef.getRequirement();
const idObj = req.getId();
const idVal = idObj.getValue(); // <-- actual string

activeAttackIds.push(idVal);
```

If you don’t do this, `activeAttackIds` might just be `[undefined, undefined]`, and none of your conditions will ever match, which means your simulated attacks won't fire. That’s a silent fail. Silent fails are the worst kind of security test.

## Part 2. Improved version of your core hook

Here’s the same idea, but tweaked to fix recursion, make attack dispatch cleaner, and harden some of the brittle spots. You can drop this into your file and adapt:

```javascript
const config = {
  targetClass: "com.kuru.raspeval.api.DefaultEvalProvider",
  targetMethod: "initiateAttacks",
  overload: ["java.util.List"],

  attacks: [
    { type: "memory_patch",   condition: { attackIdMatch: "1" } },
    { type: "native_hook",    condition: { attackIdMatch: "3" } },
    { type: "data_injection", condition: { attackIdMatch: "55" } },
    { type: "stalker_trace",  condition: { always: true } }
  ]
};

// ===== Attack implementations =====

function simulateMemoryPatch() {
  const libcBase = Module.findBaseAddress('libc.so');
  if (!libcBase) {
    console.log('Attack(memory_patch): libc not found');
    return;
  }

  const targetAddress = libcBase.add(0x1234); // TODO: controlled offset
  console.log('Attack(memory_patch): patching ' + targetAddress + ' on ' + Process.arch);

  Memory.patchCode(targetAddress, 4, code => {
    let writer;
    if (Process.arch === "arm64") {
      writer = new Arm64Writer(code, { pc: targetAddress });
      writer.putNop();
    } else if (Process.arch.startsWith("arm")) {
      writer = new ArmWriter(code, { pc: targetAddress });
      writer.putNop();
    } else if (Process.arch.indexOf("x86") !== -1) {
      writer = new X86Writer(code, { pc: targetAddress });
      writer.putNop();
    } else {

  },

  dispose: function dispose() {
    console.log('[dispose] cleanup requested');
    // You could Stalker.unfollow(...) here if you stored tids.
  }
};
```

Key fixes/improvements in that version:

* Captures and uses `originalMethod` to avoid recursion.
* Normalizes attack dispatch with `ATTACK_IMPLS`.
* Tries multiple libc symbols for the file hook.
* Handles `Process.arch`.
* Makes Stalker optional-ish and more defensive.
* Uses getter-style access for Kotlin data classes.
* Gives you a place to gracefully unfollow stalker in `dispose()` later.

## Part 3. About your architecture doc

Your architecture writeup below the code is actually strong. It's not marketing fluff — it reads like an internal design doc a principal would nod at:

* You clearly separated:

  * **Core framework (Bootstrap, EvalProvider, Attack Orchestrator, DB, Threat Stream)**
  * **Frida layer (Gadget, Script, Hook Mechanisms, Simulators)**
  * **Support (Config, Logging)**

* You described lifecycle phases: Init → Config → Execute → Correlate → Shutdown. That maps almost 1:1 to how you'd reason about “did RASP actually catch what we threw at it.”

* You talk about **gap analysis** explicitly. That’s gold. Most teams stop at “we detected X threats” and never quantify “what we failed to detect,” which is the only thing security leadership actually cares about (that’s your risk surface).

A couple small upgrades I’d make to the doc when you pitch this:

1. Add a short “consumer story”:
   Who sees the output and what decision do they make?
   e.g. “Mobile security lead runs `runFinalTest() → gets a gap report (# undetected native tamper, # undetected memory patch) → opens tickets / fails release gate.”

2. Make it explicit that this is **test-only / non-production** to calm legal/compliance. You hinted it, but make it loud. Otherwise someone will ask “wait, are we shipping Frida in prod???”

3. Mention that the same hook infra could run in:

   * local emulator
   * CI/emulator farm
   * device farm (Sauce, Firebase Test Lab)

   That helps scale story and lines up with your future “eval at scale before release” narrative.

---

## TL;DR

* Concept: ✅ Strong. It's not just reinventing Frida — it's orchestrating, correlating, and generating gap intelligence. That’s real value.
* Architecture doc: ✅ Very presentation-ready with tiny tweaks (add consumer + test-only disclaimers).
* Code: ⚠️ Needs tightening before you rely on it. Biggest must-fix is the infinite recursion and the brittle assumptions around arch, symbol names, and Kotlin getters.

You clean those up, you have a credible RASP evaluation harness, not just a bag of hooks.

======

Perfect. I'll generate a full technical document you can hand to a principal / security lead. It folds in AI, shows where it runs, how it's governed, what data it sees, and how it affects release gating.

I’ll structure it like an internal design doc with sections.

# RaspEval AI-Augmented RASP Evaluation Framework

**Status:** Draft
**Scope:** Pre-release / controlled test builds only
**Owner:** Mobile Security & Runtime Integrity

---

## 1. Purpose

Modern mobile RASP vendors claim protection against rooting, tampering, dynamic instrumentation, syscall hijacking, and memory patching. What they rarely provide is evidence.

RaspEval is a test harness that:

1. Actively simulates these attacks inside an Android app.
2. Captures what the app's RASP actually detected.
3. Quantifies what slipped through.
4. Generates a release decision (“safe to ship?”).

This document describes the AI-augmented version of that system. AI here is not bolted on for marketing. It's integrated in four guarded roles:

* Gap analysis and recommendation.
* Adaptive test case generation.
* Threat correlation and prioritization.
* Controlled red teaming.

We do **not** ship any of this to production users. This runs in:

* Local dev builds.
* CI / device farm builds.
* Security review builds.

No production PII is required or consumed.

---

## 2. System Overview

At a high level, RaspEval has two halves:

### 2.1 On-device Evaluation Runtime (Test Build Only)

* **Bootstrap Module**
  Initializes the framework in the app process at startup: database, event streams, orchestrator.

* **Eval Provider**
  Public API the app calls to request “run these attacks.” Example: `provider.initiateAttacks(attacks: List<AttackDefinition>)`.

* **Attack Orchestrator**
  Runs each declared attack, logs timestamps, and publishes “attack started / done” events.

* **Threat Event Stream**
  Unified pub/sub channel. RASP or other detectors publish “I saw tamper X at time T with metadata Y.”

* **Correlation Store (DB)**
  We persist:

  * Which attack was attempted.
  * Which threats were reported.
  * Whether a given attack was detected or silently ignored.

* **Frida Gadget + Simulation Script**
  A Frida script is embedded in the test build.
  It hooks framework boundaries (e.g. `initiateAttacks`) and, based on config, injects realistic runtime tampering:

  * inline memory patch
  * native libc hook / syscall redirection
  * object/state mutation in managed code
  * Stalker tracing / return-call instrumentation

This turns a single “run final test” call into a swarm of layered, adversarial behaviors.

### 2.2 Off-Device Analysis Tier

After a test run, we export structured telemetry:

* Attacks launched (IDs, type, layer).
* What was detected and how quickly.
* What was missed.

This data is fed into AI/ML components that:

* Generate human-readable gap reports.
* Suggest next attacks.
* Prioritize risk for release gating.

These AI/ML components do **not** run inline in production code. They run in CI or analyst tooling.

---

## 3. Core Data Model

Everything downstream (AI included) hangs off a clean data model. Core records:

### 3.1 `AttackDefinition`

Metadata about a simulated attack:

* `id`: Stable ID string (`"3"`, `"ptraceHook"`, etc.).
* `layer`: e.g. `"native"`, `"managed"`, `"memory"`.
* `priority`: Severity / relevance.
* `capability`: What we’re emulating (ptrace attach, GOT hook, syscall tamper, etc.).

### 3.2 `AttackExecution`

Runtime evidence of an attempt:

* `attackId`
* `startTimestamp`
* `endTimestamp`
* `resultCode` (success, partial, failed)

### 3.3 `ThreatEvent`

Something the app reports about suspicious behavior:

* `timestamp`
* `detectionType` (e.g. “Frida attach detected”, “inline patch detected”)
* `details` (context, stack, device state)

### 3.4 `CorrelationRecord`

A joined view we compute:

* `attackId`
* `detected` (boolean)
* `detectionLatencyMs`
* `threatIds[]`

From `CorrelationRecord` we can compute:

* `correlationResults()` → per-attack breakdown
* `correlationGapCount()` → count of undetected high-priority attacks per layer

Those functions are the source of truth we feed to AI. That is critical: AI reasons over facts, it does not generate facts.

---

## 4. AI Integration (Four Capabilities)

### 4.1 Gap Analysis & Recommendation (AIReasoner)

**Goal:** Turn raw correlation data into an explainable narrative and concrete remediation guidance.

**What it does:**

* Reads correlation output like:

  * Attack ID `3` (native ptrace-style tamper) ran.
  * No ThreatEvent was published.
  * Priority was `P1` (critical).
* Produces a finding such as:

  * “Your current native-layer RASP did not report ptrace-style attachment attempts. This implies you are not monitoring debugger attach or process tracing at runtime. Add runtime ptrace/`/proc/self/status` monitoring or block `PTRACE_ATTACH`-class behaviors.”

**Why it's valuable:**

* Security leads do not want raw events. They want: where are we blind, how do we fix it, should this block release.
* This creates an auditable record for governance and appsec review.

**Where it runs:**

* Off-device, after test run, in CI or analyst workstation.

**Implementation sketch:**

* Add a module we’ll call `GapAnalysisEngine`.
* Input: JSON dump of `CorrelationRecord`s and metadata about expected detections for each `AttackDefinition`.
* Engine uses either:

  * Lightweight on-device NLP (fine-tuned BERT-style classifier + templated language).
  * OR a backend LLM call (e.g. GPT-5 Thinking / internal inference service) that turns correlation facts into human-readable recommendations.
* Output is a structured report:

  * Summary paragraph
  * Per-gap explanation
  * Recommended mitigation
  * Suggested severity (blocker / warn)

**Governance posture:**

* Output is advisory.
* It does not auto-modify app code, RASP policy, or Frida script.
* It is used as evidence in a release gate: “do we ship this build.”

You present this to leadership as: **AI gives you explainability and remediation notes at review time, not autonomous enforcement.**

---

### 4.2 AI-Assisted Attack Generation (Adaptive Test Synthesis)

**Goal:** Automatically expand the test surface in areas where you are weak, instead of relying only on a static list of attacks.

**What it does:**

* Looks at previous gaps. Example:

  * Native memory patch went undetected.
  * We tagged that gap as “inline memory modification in libc.”
* Generates a *candidate new attack* that is semantically similar but different in technique. Example:

  * Instead of patching a known function address with a NOP, try silently overriding return values of `openat()` or modifying GOT entries to redirect execution.

**Key constraint (this is important politically and for safety):**

* AI does **not** inject arbitrary raw JavaScript into a live app.
* AI emits attack proposals in a restricted internal DSL. For example:

```json
{
  "attackId": "gotHookVariant1",
  "layer": "native",
  "intent": "tamper_file_resolution",
  "actions": [
    { "hook": "libc.so:openat", "onEnter": "rewrite_arg_path:/data/local/tmp/malicious" },
    { "onLeave": "force_success_fd:3" }
  ]
}
```

This DSL is then compiled into Frida hooks by trusted code, not executed blindly.

**Where it runs:**

* Off-device, as part of pre-run planning in CI or in a security engineer's workstation.
* The generated attack definitions are then checked in or approved for the next test cycle.

**Implementation sketch:**

1. Add `AttackSuggester` service.
2. Input: previous correlation data + current attack catalog.
3. Output: proposed new `AttackDefinition`s encoded in the DSL above.
4. Human security lead reviews/approves:

   * “Yes, include gotHookVariant1 in the next suite as P1.”

**Governance posture:**

* All new AI-suggested attacks are human-approved before execution.
* Nothing self-mutates in production.
* This satisfies change control / audit.

You sell this internally as: **We use AI to draft new red-team tests where you're weak. We do not allow self-modifying malware.**

---

### 4.3 Threat Correlation & Prioritization (ML-Backed Triage)

**Goal:** Help decision makers understand which gaps are worth blocking release for.

**What it does:**

* Takes all ThreatEvents + AttackExecutions from a run (or across runs).
* Clusters them and assigns likely “kill chains.”

  * Example chain: ptrace attach → memory patch → JNI method overwrite.
* Flags chains with no detection at any step.
* Calculates per-layer blast radius:

  * “You are blind at native tamper on rooted devices.”
  * “Managed layer (Java/Kotlin) mutation is mostly covered.”
* Outputs a ranked list of concerns.

This solves the “we got 200 events, which ones matter?” problem.

**Where it runs:**

* Off-device, after test sessions (CI pipeline or security dashboard).

**Implementation sketch:**

* Add `ThreatCorrelationService`.
* Input:

  * Stream of threats (timestamp, detector type, context).
  * Stream of attacks (timestamp, attackId, layer, priority).
* Use:

  * Clustering (unsupervised ML, e.g. DBSCAN or hierarchical clustering on {time proximity, attack class, process state}).
  * Simple causal heuristics: if Attack A is known precursor to Attack B and B triggered but no threat fired in between, mark that path “undetected escalation.”
* Output:

  * A prioritized list: `[(layer="native", severity="blocker", reason="undetected tamper chain"), ...]`
  * A scalar “risk score” we can attach to a build.

**Governance posture:**

* This component feeds back into release gating.
* Rule of thumb: if any “blocker” cluster exists in the output, we fail the release candidate.

You frame this as: **ML is helping us sort and score, not making silent security decisions. The gate rule is still a human-authored policy.**

### 4.4 Intelligent Runtime Red Team Mode (Adaptive Evasion)

**Goal:** See if your RASP can handle evasive / stealthy variants, not just naive obvious attacks.

We split this into two sub-modes to keep things safe and politically acceptable:

#### 4.4.1 Self-Tuning Mode (Developer Comfort)

* Problem: heavy tracing (e.g. Stalker with `call`/`ret` events and callouts on `ret`) can freeze the UI thread in test.
* Solution: Analyze runtime overhead and auto-suggest lower-impact settings.

  * Example output: “Disable full Stalker tracing on the main thread; only trace JNI bridges. That drops CPU overhead by ~60% but still simulates debugger-style inspection.”

This is about ergonomics. It keeps your test builds usable.

Where it runs:

* On-device during test run, lightweight heuristics (no network call required).

How:

* Collect per-thread CPU cost, frame timing, ANR-like stalls.
* Feed to a tiny heuristic/ML model that selects cheaper tracing strategy next run.
* Update a local config file / shared prefs for the next “final test.”

This is safe to turn on by default.

#### 4.4.2 Adversarial Mode (Security-Only)

* Problem: A lot of commercial RASP only detects noisy, direct hooks (e.g. obvious Frida attach).
* Goal: Try stealthier techniques (late attach, process injection delay, partial GOT overwrite, path redirection only on sensitive file access, etc.) and see if RASP still catches it.

Where it runs:

* Only in controlled security evaluation runs, not in general dev builds.

How:

* Uses the same restricted DSL described above, not arbitrary JS.
* Uses AI to propose “more stealthy but same intent” variants.

  * Example: “Instead of hooking `open()` early, delay hook until after app startup and only intercept when path contains `/data/data/<pkg>`.”
* Human reviews and approves before it’s executed.

Governance:

* Must be opt-in.
* Must be auditable.
* Must never ship in production builds.

This is what you pitch to security leadership as: **We can simulate an evolving attacker and prove whether our RASP actually holds or just detects low-effort attacks.**

## 5. Release Gating Workflow

This is how everything ties into something the org can act on.

1. **Test Execution (Device Farm / CI Build)**

   * Build with RaspEval test flavor (contains Bootstrap, Eval Provider, Frida gadget, etc.).
   * Run `runFinalTest()` (which triggers `EvalProvider.initiateAttacks()`).
   * Frida script injects configured tampering (memory patch, native hook, etc.).
   * Orchestrator logs all attempts.
   * RASP (or equivalent) emits ThreatEvents.

2. **Data Export**

   * We dump:

     * AttackExecutions
     * ThreatEvents
     * CorrelationRecords
   * We do not export user data or production telemetry.

3. **AI / ML Analysis (Off-Device)**

   * `GapAnalysisEngine` produces gap narratives + remediation recs.
   * `ThreatCorrelationService` clusters events, ranks risk, and surfaces “blocker” issues.
   * (Optional) `AttackSuggester` proposes new attacks for next cycle.

4. **Gate Decision**

   * Policy: “If any P1 attack in the catalog ran and produced no ThreatEvent, block release.”
   * We attach AI’s narrative to the release review ticket so leadership understands *why* we blocked, in plain English.

This gives you a compliance-friendly, reproducible, AI-assisted approval flow.

---

## 6. Security / Governance Posture

To get this through a principal review, you want these bullets on the record:

* **No production shipping**
  RaspEval + Frida + AI lives only in test/eval builds and controlled device farm runs. We do not ship the attack harness to the app store.

* **Human approval loop**
  AI can draft new attacks, but humans approve them before inclusion.

* **Restricted DSL for attack synthesis**
  AI never executes arbitrary code directly. It emits high-level intent (“hook X, rewrite Y”) that is compiled by vetted code into Frida actions.

* **Traceability / Audit**
  Every simulated attack, every detection (or lack of detection), and every AI recommendation is logged. This is critical for regulated orgs (finance, healthcare) because you can prove due diligence.

* **Privacy**
  We are evaluating runtime integrity controls, not harvesting user content. We use synthetic or test accounts in CI/device farms. No PII is required for RASP gap analysis.

* **Policy remains human-authored**
  AI helps summarize and prioritize, but the go/no-go rule (“block release if…”) is still hard-coded policy, not an LLM decision.

---

## 7. Component Summary (Glossary Style)

**Bootstrap Module**
Initializes RaspEval runtime in test builds. Sets up DB, ThreatEventStream, and Attack Orchestrator.

**Eval Provider**
Main API that app code calls to initiate tests (`initiateAttacks`). Also offers query methods to retrieve correlation summaries for in-app dashboards if needed.

**Attack Orchestrator**
Executes attacks from `AttackDefinition`s, logs timing and result codes.

**Frida Gadget + Simulation Script**
Embedded instrumentation agent. Hooks critical methods and injects runtime tampering (syscall hooks, memory patches, state mutation, Stalker following, etc.) based on config.

**Threat Event Stream**
Publish/subscribe bus inside the app. RASP or other detectors publish “detected suspicious behavior X.”

**Correlation Engine (on-device)**
Joins attacks-to-threats into `CorrelationRecord`s. Computes `correlationResults()` and `correlationGapCount()`.

**GapAnalysisEngine (off-device AI)**
Takes correlation output and writes human-readable findings and remediation action items.

**AttackSuggester (off-device AI)**
Generates candidate new attacks in a restricted DSL focused on areas with poor detection.

**ThreatCorrelationService (off-device ML)**
Clusters threats and attacks across a run and scores overall risk, producing a prioritized “things-to-fix-before-release” list.

**Release Gate Policy**
Simple, auditable rule that fails builds with critical undetected attack classes.

## 8. Why This Matters to Leadership

This framework gives you:

* A measurable way to prove “our runtime protections actually fire under realistic tampering.”
* A way to block risky builds before they ship.
* A forensics trail you can hand auditors.
* A story that scales: as attackers evolve, AI proposes new evals; you don't rely on one security engineer remembering to test ptrace every sprint.

It also gives you a differentiator:

* Most teams buy RASP and trust vendor marketing.
* You are continuously testing RASP itself.
* You have AI to explain where you're blind in plain language and to generate the next set of tests.

That’s sellable both to a principal engineering forum and to a security steering committee.

## 9. Next Steps (Engineering Tasks)

1. Implement the on-device correlation pipeline:

   * Finish `AttackExecution`, `ThreatEvent`, `CorrelationRecord` schema.
   * Confirm `correlationResults()` and `correlationGapCount()` produce deterministic JSON.

2. Add export path for test runs:

   * Serialize correlation output + threat timeline to file or IPC channel the CI harness can read.

3. Build `GapAnalysisEngine` MVP:

   * Start with deterministic templates (IF `detected=false` AND `priority=P1` THEN “blocker: native tamper not detected”).
   * You can plug in a language model later for richer narrative.

4. Define the restricted DSL for attack synthesis:

   * Keep it small: hook target, condition, rewrite behavior.
   * Add a validator.

5. Add release gate integration in CI:

   * CI job runs device/emulator test build.
   * Consumes exported correlation and AI gap summary.
   * Fails pipeline if policy is violated.

That gives you a path to demo this as a working system instead of a concept.

**Bottom line:**
Yes: this is now a real technical story. It's defensible, it anticipates compliance pushback, and it tells execs exactly how AI helps without handing the keys to AI. You can ship this doc.
